# JavaScript Algorithms and Visualizations

This repository is my journey in learning data structures, algorithms, and core JavaScript. I aim to understand algorithms deeply by implementing them from scratch in pure JavaScript and visualizing them using the HTML Canvas API.

## Topics
- **Algorithms**: Implementations of common algorithms such as binary search, sorting, etc.
- **Data Structures**: Examples of stacks, queues, trees, and more.
- **Canvas Visualizations**: Visual representations of algorithms to better understand their behavior.

## Goals
- Master JavaScript by building foundational algorithms and data structures.
- Learn the HTML Canvas API for dynamic visualizations.
- Document each algorithmâ€™s logic, complexity, and use cases.
